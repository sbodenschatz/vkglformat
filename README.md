# vkglformat

This repository contains two headers for converting between Vulkan and OpenGL format-related enum values, extracted from the old version of https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples (now available at https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples-Deprecated ) and combined with a simple CMakeLists.txt file to allow inclusion as a subirectory into a CMake project.
